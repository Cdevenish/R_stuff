### R as a calculator

*Get the worksheet here:* [worksheet 1](../resources/w01_calculator.r)

```{r maths, echo = T}
1 + 1

10 - 5

10 / 2

2^3  # 2 to the power of 3

2 * 5  # with or without spaces - doesn't make a difference

2*5
```

Using spaces and lines between your code can make it easier to read. Don't forget to make lots of comments with #

### How to find help

In R, use `?` or `help()`

Help with operators:

`? Arithmetic`

Or with the help function: 
`help(Arithmetic)`

Be careful with the order of the operators...

- `^`
- `*  /`
- `+  -`

See here:
`? Syntax`


```{r}
10 + 10 / 2 - 1

(10 + 10) /2 - 1

8 - 4 * 4 + 2 
```

In RStudio, you can select part of the code on one line and run it with ctrl + enter

If you're not sure about the order of the operators, use brackets...


```{r}
10 + (10 / 2) - 1

10 + 10 / 2 - 1
```
